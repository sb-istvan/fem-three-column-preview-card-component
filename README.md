## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media query

### What I learned

I started with mobile view and then originated desktop version from there. Relatively few attributes needed to be changed within media query. There might as well be a solution without using media query.

### Continued development

My solution works well on the two target resolutions (desktop and mobile 375px) but the screen widths in between would need some thinking over. However this was not part of the challenge.
